SWO host metrics receiver generates metrics related to host. Receiver's purpose is to deliver functionality, which is not currently part of [opentelemetry-collector-contrib], or existing
implementation in contrib differs from our expectations.

## Receiver Configuration

Receiver supports collection interval configuration and generaly collection of scrapers.

```yaml
swohostmetrics:
  collection_interval: <duration> # default = 30s
  scrapers:
    <scraper1>:
    <scraper2>:
    ...
```

## Available Scrapers

| Scraper     | Supported OSs                | Description                                                |
|-------------| ---------------------------- |------------------------------------------------------------|
| [hostinfo]  | Linux & Windows              | Provides information about host entity itself              |
| [asset]     | Linux & Windows              | Provides information about installed software and features |
| [processes] | Linux & Windows              | Provides information about processes                       |
