### Contribution Checklist

Please ensure your PR meets the following requirements (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)):

- [ ] **CHANGELOG updated** - Added entry under `## vNext` (chore PRs are a possible exeption)
- [ ] **Tests included** - Unit tests, generated tests (`mdatagen`), and/or integration tests
- [ ] **Documentation updated** - README.md with config examples and behavior description

**For new components:**
- [ ] **Codeowners** - Approver/maintainer assigned
- [ ] **Use case documented** - Reasoning, telemetry types, configuration options described in issue
- [ ] `metadata.yaml` with correct type, stability, and distributions
- [ ] `doc.go` with `//go:generate mdatagen metadata.yaml`
- [ ] README.md with autogeneration markers (`<!-- status autogenerated section -->`)\
- [ ] README.md contains exhaustive configuration documentation
- [ ] Generated files created via `mdatagen` in component directory
- [ ] **Telemetry names registered** - New metrics registered (if applicable)
- **Component release** - New components need to be added into the release (one or multiple distributions in [releases repository](https://github.com/solarwinds-cloud/solarwinds-otel-collector-releases/distributions/verified/manifest.yaml)).  
That can be done only after the new component has been merged, and released (happens weekly).
